title:  "Hammering with Chrome Dev Tools"
---

About 15 minutes ago, I was working on a project and needed a list of the 50 states in the US. Not only that, I needed them in the form of an array of strings. Now sure, I could have just done the copy/paste routine from [this site](http://state.1keydata.com/) and done some tedious line-wise editing in Sublime, but instead, I decided to bust out my trusty hammer, Chrome Dev Tools[^disclaimer].

TL;DR:

![Screen Thing](/images/devtools.gif)

First, a cursory glance at the DOM reveals that the states are wrapped in `a` tags, which are all within a `div` with `id="colwrap"`. Excellent. We can now craft a CSS selector that will return all of the nodes we need.

{% highlight javascript %}
$$('#colwrap a')
{% endhighlight %}

No, that's not a typo. Chrome Dev Tools aliases `querySelectorAll` to `$$`. We're using standard DOM API's, which means jQuery doesn't need to be on the page.

Now, in the Dev Tools console, we see what looks like an array, but unfortunately, `querySelectorAll` actually returns a NodeList, which is an array-like object but doesn't have `Array.prototype`'s methods. This is because the DOM API guys were jerks. This means we can't use cool array methods like `map` or `filter`.

However, in rebellious fashion, we can take advantage of the fact that `NodeList`s look a lot like arrays (they're "array-like objects"). Thus, we can use array methods on them with a little bit of JS black magic:

{% highlight javascript %}
[].slice.call($$('#colwrap a'), 0)
{% endhighlight %}

We've basically converted the NodeList into an array with the ol' `.slice(0)` array-copying trick.

Now it's a matter of `map`ing over the nodes and grabbing their `innerText`:

{% highlight javascript %}
[].slice.call($$('#colwrap a'), 0).map(function(node) {
  return node.innerText;
})
{% endhighlight %}

At this point, we *could* copy and paste from the console to our trusty editor, but that requires lifting our hands from the keyboard to go for the mouse. Instead, we can use the Dev Tools `copy` function, which moves anything you pass it into the clipboard. So our final complete command is

{% highlight javascript %}
copy([].slice.call($$('#colwrap a'), 0).map(function(node) {
  return node.innerText;
}))
{% endhighlight %}

**Paste**. Done![^done]

[^disclaimer]: This might seem like a contrived example, but I legitimately did this in order to get the list of 50 states formatted as an array of strings. Only then did I realize that this is a good demo of what you can do with Chrome Dev Tools.

[^done]: In practice, I don't actually magically type out that last command off the top of my head. I usually build up to that by making judicious use of `$_`, which returns the result of the last executed command. See the TL;DR above.
