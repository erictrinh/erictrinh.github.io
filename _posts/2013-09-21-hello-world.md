It took me one year and 3 months to write this blog post.

I'd bought the domain name back in June 2012 as a compulsive buy when I found out Namecheap was having a sale. At the time, I'd promised myself I'd do something interesting with the domain. I had grand thoughts about putting up a portfolio or at the very least having some real estate on the web for me to post my thoughts.

Of course, that didn't happen. I was always looking for reasons not to put it online. *You're a front-end web developer for godsake*, I'd think. *No one's going to take you seriously if you have a cookie cutter site.* Every few months, I'd start a new PSD and start throwing some "lorem ipsum" into it. I toyed with different colors, with different layouts. Once or twice, I even came close to mocking up something I actually liked.

But I always second-guessed myself. Is the pastel green color scheme *really* me? What font should I use? And why can't I come up with anything that actually looks nice?

The problem was that the idea of the site was so strongly tied to my identity. Did I want to come off as funny and whimsical? Smart and sophisticated? Witty, yet profound? I knew that the design could make or break the impression I wanted to convey to readers.

It took a while for me to realize this was silly. I'm not a visual designer. Sure, I like thinking about design, and I like designing great interactions on the web, but I'm bad at making things look pretty. I wanted to convey ideas in my blog, and I wasn't doing that by dicking around in Photoshop for months with nothing to show for it.

The function of a blog is to be a frame around the real star of the show: content. I'd wasted time worrying about superficial details (the frame) when what I really should have done was ship a minimum viable product (content). For my blog, that's a generic [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/)-generated site. It took me 2 minutes to get started with Jekyll, 10 minutes to write this post, and 5 minutes to get it deployed on GitHub. That's a grand total of 20-ish minutes of my time, and an infinitesimal fraction of the time I spent worrying about whether my non-existent readers would like the design of my site.

Now, am I crazy about the default Jekyll theme? Not particularly. I'm painfully aware of its inadequacies, but now that it's out there, I'll be more motivated to improve it. Although, hey, it looks identical to [Tom Preston-Werner's blog](http://tom.preston-werner.com/), so how bad could it really be?
